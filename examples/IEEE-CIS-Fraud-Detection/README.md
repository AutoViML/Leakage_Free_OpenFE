Please first download data from https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/ieee-fraud-detection/data and place the Kaggle data into './data/' folder (relative to IEEE.py). Then you can run IEEE.py to evaluate the effectiveness of OpenFE in the IEEE-CIS Fraud Detection Kaggle competition. 

If you want to use features generated by OpenFE to boost the model performance, set ```use_openfe``` to True and ```use_expertfe``` to False in IEEE.py. If you want to use features provided by the first-place team in this competition, set ```use_expertfe``` to True and ```use_openfe``` to False.
